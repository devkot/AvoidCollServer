Group project in University of Athens used to extend AvoidColl application to go online and connect to an MQTT broker. This repository contains the code for the Java application running on the server.

This application collects data from different devices running the AvoidColl app. It uses mosquitto as an MQTT broker and the publish/subscribe pattern. It performs calculations and determines whether the thresholds are surpassed and then publishes a message to warn the specific device. All collisions are written in a database. If two users collide within 1 second then it is marked as a confirmed collision and the message is changed accordingly. It uses threads to handle the data load and prevent congestions. There is a JavaFX UI available to perform queries(unfinished) on the database.
